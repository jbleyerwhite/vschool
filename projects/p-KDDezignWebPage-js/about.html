                <h2>Julee Bleyer-White</h2>
                <h3>Founder, Owner</h3>
                    <p>Julee did not come from the land of traditional landscape experts and architects.  She's a creative visionary with a rich background of action, travel, and culture.  From an educated food scientist to medical device sales professional, Julee has travelled the country and many parts of our amazing world.  Inspried by her time living abroad, in England, she has put her focus on her passion: color, flowers, people  and design.  With that, Krazy Daizy Dezign was born.</p>

                    <P>Starting from scratch, she designed her first garden at her home 15 years ago, that was recognized as an award winning garden in Cincinnati.  Her garden was published as 'Avant Garden' in Cincinnati.  This was the true catalyst behind her passion with creating flower pots and garden design.</P>
